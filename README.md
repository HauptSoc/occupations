In this repository are all the materials needed to replicate the analysis conducted in "The Social Psychology of Occupational Status Groups: Relationality in the Structure of Deference." The primary script is Occupations Manuscript RR.Rmd, which includes a version of the main text of the paper along with the code needed to run each part of the analysis. 

Inside the Data folder are the BayesACT deference matrix, the most recent US ACT dictionary, and the ACT equation coefficients.
